# What

* Simple go program that generates a deck of playing cards and supplies simple methods for expected deck functions, i.e shuffling, dealing, etc. to explore the basics of the go langauge 

# Why

* I've been meaning to learn Go for some time now for personal and professional reasons, this was a good starter to learn the basics, i.e. packaging, variables, functions, types, testing, etc.

* Whether I want to acknowledge it or not, I've been very depressed lately. Programming used to be a source of inspiration and a passion for me, yet lately it has only been a nominal contributor to my depression / stress. <br><br>
I haven't actually done programming as a hobby in a couple of months now, and I really do miss that feeling of learning / exploring something new. Hopefully this helps in fighting off the depression and burn out, ...who knows ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
